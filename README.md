Repository for Vossen &amp; Konijnen Project by Vrijepinguins.

A very simplistic simulation built in Java. It features foxes, pinguins, rabbits, hunters, druids and even an atomic bomb!

Feel free to download this project and modify it the way you want! Do you want to add goats? Of course you would want that!

We always like feedback. Don't forget to send us your questions and/or mods as well!
